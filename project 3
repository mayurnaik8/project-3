step wise building:

step 1 
Planning the Features
Users should be able to input daily expenses, including amount, description, and category.
The application needs to store expense data in a data structure or file for retrieval.
Expenses must be categorized (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
Provide users with the ability to analyze their expenses, offering monthly summaries and category-wise breakdowns.
Implement a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the application.
Include error handling for user input validation and unexpected issues.
Ensure the code is well-documented for clarity and maintainability.

step 2
Set Up Data Structures
Design a way to store expenses, either in memory (lists or dictionaries) or using persistent storage like JSON, CSV, or a database. Each expense will include:
Amount spent
A short description of the expense
The category of the expense (e.g., food, entertainment)

step3
Create a Function for Adding Expenses
Develop a function to handle user input for adding expenses. This function will collect details such as the amount spent, a description of the expense, and its category. Make sure to validate inputs to prevent invalid entries (e.g., non-numeric amounts).

step 4
Store the Expenses
Once the user provides the expense details, store them in a data structure like a list or dictionary. For persistent storage, save the data to a file (e.g., JSON or CSV). Ensure the data can be retrieved later for analysis or modification.

step 5
Categorize Expenses
Implement functionality to allow users to categorize their expenses. Categories such as food, transportation, utilities, and entertainment will help in organizing the data. This will be useful for future summaries and reports.

step 6
Analyze and Summarize Data
Develop analysis tools that allow users to view monthly expense summaries or category-wise breakdowns. This can include:
Total monthly expenditure
Total expenses per category
Optionally, graphical representations of the data using charts or graphs

step 7
Build the User Interface
Create a basic user interface, starting with a command-line interface (CLI) where users can:
Add new expenses
View summaries of expenses
Exit the application
Once the basic functionality is complete, consider upgrading to a graphical user interface (GUI) using a framework like Tkinter.

step 8
Add Error Handling
Implement error handling mechanisms throughout the application to ensure smooth user interaction. Handle scenarios like invalid input (e.g., non-numeric entries) or missing data. Use clear error messages to guide the user to correct their input.
